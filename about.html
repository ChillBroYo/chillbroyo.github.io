    <!-- STORY -->
    <section class="about-section section">
      <h2>From Immigrant Roots</h2>
      <p>
        I arrived in San Diego at eight months old, born in Sudan to Eritrean
        refugee parents who fled conflict to build a new life here. Education was
        my family’s path to opportunity and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, my siblings and I were bused out of underperforming District 4
        schools. In 1999, we settled in Emerald Hills — a Black, working-class
        neighborhood rich in pride, resilience, and community.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="about-section section alt">
      <h2>A Nurse, a Single Mom, an Advocate</h2>
      <p>
        I became a mother as a teenager and raised my son while pursuing my nursing
        degree at SDSU. For over a decade, I worked in the NICU caring for our most
        vulnerable lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I later earned my Master’s Degree in Nursing and founded a home-care agency
        for seniors — bringing dignity, compassion, and medical expertise to people
        aging at home.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="about-section section">
      <h2>Advocating for Justice & Equity</h2>
      <p>
        I organized against discriminatory zoning policies like Footnote 7,
        helping lead a grassroots effort that forced the city to repeal it in 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        When developers proposed hundreds of ADUs on single-family lots without
        infrastructure support, our community organized again — and won.
