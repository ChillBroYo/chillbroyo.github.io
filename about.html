  <h1>Who I Am</h1>
  <p>
    A neighbor who listens, a nurse who advocates, and a leader who brings
    community voices into rooms where decisions are made.
  </p>

  <h2>From Immigrant Roots</h2>
  <p>
    I arrived in San Diego at eight months old, born in Sudan to Eritrean refugee
    parents who fled conflict to build a new life here. Education was my family’s
    path to opportunity and stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Growing up, my siblings and I were bused out of underperforming District 4
    schools. In 1999, we settled in Emerald Hills — a Black, working-class
    neighborhood rich in pride, resilience, and community.
  </p>

  <h2>A Nurse, a Single Mom, an Advocate</h2>
  <p>
    I became a mother as a teenager and raised my son while pursuing my nursing
    degree at SDSU. For over a decade, I worked in the NICU caring for our most
    vulnerable lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    I later earned my Master’s Degree in Nursing and founded a home-care agency
    for seniors — bringing dignity, compassion, and medical expertise to people
    aging at home.
  </p>

  <h2>Advocating for Justice & Equity</h2>
  <p>
    I organized against discriminatory zoning policies like Footnote 7, helping
    lead a grassroots effort that forced the city to repeal it in 2025.
  </p>

  <p>
    When developers proposed hundreds of ADUs on single-family lots without
    infrastructure support, our community organized again — and won.
