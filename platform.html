          <h1>Our Campaign Priorities</h1>
          <p>
            I am committed to advocating for and helping build a San Diego where
            all communities can thrive, be housed, and live quality lives. My
            identities and lived experiences have enabled me to see our system
            and societies from the margins, and I hope to use that knowledge
            alongside communities and other responsive leaders to build a better
            District 4 and San Diego for all of us. I will bring integrity,
            accountability, equity and inclusion back to City Hall striving to
            reduce social and economic disparity and empower our community and
            future generations.

            Underpinning the needs and priorities of District 4 and its
            residents is my strong belief in community involvement. I am
            committed to transparency and collaboration with the community. I
            will provide forums and regular opportunities to hear from and learn
            from the residents and businesses of District 4.

        <h2>Community Development and Housing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="no-bullets">
            For decades, District 4 has been used as a dumping ground for
            developments that wealthier communities would never accept,
            concentrating poverty while denying us investment, infrastructure,
            and opportunity
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="list-bump">
          <li>
            Stable, safe, decent housing is the foundation of public health.
            When families are displaced by thoughtless redevelopment, children
            lose their schools, elders lose their support networks, and
            stress-related illnesses rise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Housing justice and responsible redevelopment means healthier, more
            stable lives. I will fight for and demand:
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthened tenant protections, eviction defense, and pathways to
            homeownership for residents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upholding and funding the Community Plans in District 4, ensuring
            residents, not developers, shape our future
          </li>
          <li>
            Pushing for implementation of Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing
            citywide so that lower income families have the option to live in
            areas that have resources and opportunities that will enhance their
            quality of life
          </li>
          <li>
            Fair-share development, creating communities for people of all
            socio-economic levels, across all council districts, not just
            District 4.
          </li>
          <li>
            An end to policies that deepen segregation by overloading District 4
            with high-density subsidized units while wealthier districts are
            protected.

        <h2>Infrastructure That Serves the People</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="no-bullets">
            Infrastructure is more than roads, sidewalks, streetlights, and
            parks, it's a visual representation of fairness, dignity and
            opportunity. We have seen that when infrastructure fails or is
            non-existent, the price is paid by our physical and mental health.
            Investing in infrastructure is investing in people, it’s how we
            honor the resilience of our community and right the decades of
            historic neglect. Investing in infrastructure improves people’s
            health and quality of life. Through equity-driven budgeting and
            intentional rebuilding, we can safely connect people to jobs,
            students to schools, and neighbors to one another.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="list-bump">
          <li>
            Equity-Driven Capital Budgeting Push for a dedicated Infrastructure
            Fund for low and moderate resource areas, based on the California
            Tax Credit Allocation Committee/Housing and Community Development
            Opportunity Area Maps, within the city budget, so we don’t have to
            beg for basic repairs. Require and create accessible avenues for
            community input before any public works project is approved;
            residents know where the gaps are better than any city map. Partner
            with communities to coordinate infrastructure upgrades that meet
            multiple needs like mobility, public health, and public safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebuild the Basics: Sidewalks, Lighting, Drainage, and Parks Invest
            in sidewalks, street lighting, and stormwater drainage in every
            District 4 neighborhood, not just in response to Get it Done
            complaints, but as part of a proactive, justice-based capital
            improvement plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminate infrastructure deserts in areas where missing or broken
            infrastructure puts children, elders, and people with disabilities
            at risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create safer intersections and traffic calming in residential areas
            to prevent accidents and protect children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure an equitable share of climate resilience funding and
            resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upgrade storm drains to prevent flooding during storms (especially
            in low-lying areas).
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement green infrastructure like rain gardens, bioswales, and
            drought-resilient landscaping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parks as Public Health: Revitalize existing parks and acquire new
            ones where access is limited. Invest in upgrades to playgrounds,
            restrooms, walking trails, and shade structures.
